# Case 170

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

Output Format:
```

    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```

    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code performs dynamic memory allocation using 'qemu_mallocz' for 'BlkMigDevState' without a corresponding free operation, which may lead to a resource leak if the allocated memory is never deallocated. This can result in memory exhaustion over time, making the system vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
