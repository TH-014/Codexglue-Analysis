# Case 95

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 9d7a4c6690ef9962a3b20034f65008f1ea15c1d6

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
g_malloc0(size_t n_bytes)

{

    void *mem;

    __coverity_negative_sink__(n_bytes);

    mem = calloc(1, n_bytes == 0 ? 1 : n_bytes);

    if (!mem) __coverity_panic__();

    return mem;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The function uses 'calloc' with an unchecked 'n_bytes' value, allowing for a potential resource leak if 'n_bytes' is extremely large, leading to allocation failures. Moreover, passing a zero value allows for undesired behavior since 'calloc' still allocates a minimum of one byte. This can contribute to vulnerabilities in usage, depending on how the memory is managed subsequently, especially if the allocated pointer is not freed properly."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
