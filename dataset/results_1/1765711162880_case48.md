# Case 48

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 183216b21870f21c86c904a7530d53682d7db46d

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void ff_frame_thread_encoder_free(AVCodecContext *avctx){

    int i;

    ThreadContext *c= avctx->internal->frame_thread_encoder;



    pthread_mutex_lock(&c->task_fifo_mutex);

    c->exit = 1;

    pthread_cond_broadcast(&c->task_fifo_cond);

    pthread_mutex_unlock(&c->task_fifo_mutex);



    for (i=0; i<avctx->thread_count; i++) {

         pthread_join(c->worker[i], NULL);

    }



    pthread_mutex_destroy(&c->task_fifo_mutex);

    pthread_mutex_destroy(&c->finished_task_mutex);

    pthread_mutex_destroy(&c->buffer_mutex);

    pthread_cond_destroy(&c->task_fifo_cond);

    pthread_cond_destroy(&c->finished_task_cond);

    av_fifo_freep(&c->task_fifo);

    av_freep(&avctx->internal->frame_thread_encoder);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code potentially has a use-after-free vulnerability. After the condition variables and mutexes are destroyed, the 'worker' threads may still be accessing them, leading to undefined behavior if they were to proceed. Additionally, if 'pthread_join' is not adequately synchronized with accessing shared resources, this may lead to resource leaks or race conditions."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
