# Case 14

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 2c79288d4e0bcb8d3a8a908813fc9cc586dd7fdd

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
int ff_wma_end(AVCodecContext *avctx)

{

    WMACodecContext *s = avctx->priv_data;

    int i;



    for(i = 0; i < s->nb_block_sizes; i++)

        ff_mdct_end(&s->mdct_ctx[i]);

    for(i = 0; i < s->nb_block_sizes; i++)

        av_free(s->windows[i]);



    if (s->use_exp_vlc) {

        free_vlc(&s->exp_vlc);

    }

    if (s->use_noise_coding) {

        free_vlc(&s->hgain_vlc);

    }

    for(i = 0;i < 2; i++) {

        free_vlc(&s->coef_vlc[i]);

        av_free(s->run_table[i]);

        av_free(s->level_table[i]);


    }



    return 0;

}
```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 7,
    "explanation": "The pointers to allocated memory (such as 's->windows[i]') are being freed without prior null checks or ensuring that they were allocated, which could lead to double free vulnerabilities or memory corruption if the same pointer is freed multiple times."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
