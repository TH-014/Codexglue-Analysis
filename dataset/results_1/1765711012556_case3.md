## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void unterminated_dict_comma(void)

{

    QObject *obj = qobject_from_json("{'abc':32,", NULL);

    g_assert(obj == NULL);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 4,
    "explanation": "The function attempts to parse a JSON string that is improperly formatted (missing closing brace), which can lead to a resource leak if any resources allocated during parsing are not cleaned up due to early termination or errors in handling the invalid input."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
