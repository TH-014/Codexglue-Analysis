# Case 24

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 1945dbc15f0f1ffdc9a10526448e9eba7c599d98

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void openpic_irq_raise(openpic_t *opp, int n_CPU, IRQ_src_t *src)

{

    int n_ci = IDR_CI0 - n_CPU;



    if ((opp->flags & OPENPIC_FLAG_IDE_CRIT) && test_bit(&src->ide, n_ci)) {

        qemu_irq_raise(opp->dst[n_CPU].irqs[OPENPIC_OUTPUT_CINT]);

    } else {

        qemu_irq_raise(opp->dst[n_CPU].irqs[OPENPIC_OUTPUT_INT]);

    }

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code does not exhibit any signs of resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or denial of service issues. It performs a straightforward conditional check and raises an interrupt based on the flags and state without manipulating memory unsafely."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
