## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void qio_channel_socket_dgram_async(QIOChannelSocket *ioc,

                                    SocketAddress *localAddr,

                                    SocketAddress *remoteAddr,

                                    QIOTaskFunc callback,

                                    gpointer opaque,

                                    GDestroyNotify destroy)

{

    QIOTask *task = qio_task_new(

        OBJECT(ioc), callback, opaque, destroy);

    struct QIOChannelSocketDGramWorkerData *data = g_new0(

        struct QIOChannelSocketDGramWorkerData, 1);



    data->localAddr = QAPI_CLONE(SocketAddress, localAddr);

    data->remoteAddr = QAPI_CLONE(SocketAddress, remoteAddr);



    trace_qio_channel_socket_dgram_async(ioc, localAddr, remoteAddr);

    qio_task_run_in_thread(task,

                           qio_channel_socket_dgram_worker,

                           data,

                           qio_channel_socket_dgram_worker_free);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 8,
    "explanation": "The use of QAPI_CLONE for localAddr and remoteAddr without proper handling could lead to resource leaks if the memory allocated by g_new0 is not correctly freed later. Additionally, if the data structure is freed while still being accessed, this may create use-after-free vulnerabilities."
}
