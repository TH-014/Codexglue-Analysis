## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
BlockAIOCB *bdrv_aio_discard(BlockDriverState *bs,

        int64_t sector_num, int nb_sectors,

        BlockCompletionFunc *cb, void *opaque)

{

    Coroutine *co;

    BlockAIOCBCoroutine *acb;



    trace_bdrv_aio_discard(bs, sector_num, nb_sectors, opaque);



    acb = qemu_aio_get(&bdrv_em_co_aiocb_info, bs, cb, opaque);

    acb->need_bh = true;

    acb->req.error = -EINPROGRESS;

    acb->req.sector = sector_num;

    acb->req.nb_sectors = nb_sectors;

    co = qemu_coroutine_create(bdrv_aio_discard_co_entry);

    qemu_coroutine_enter(co, acb);



    bdrv_co_maybe_schedule_bh(acb);

    return &acb->common;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The function may be vulnerable to resource leaks since it does not properly manage the lifecycle of the coroutine created with 'qemu_coroutine_create'. If the coroutine is not terminated or released appropriately, it could lead to memory leaks. Moreover, if multiple requests are processed concurrently, there might be issues with handling state, potentially leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities if resources are improperly shared or reused."
}
