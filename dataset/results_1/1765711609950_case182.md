## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void smbios_check_collision(int type, int entry)

{

    if (type < ARRAY_SIZE(first_opt)) {

        if (first_opt[type].seen) {

            if (first_opt[type].headertype != entry) {

                error_report("Can't mix file= and type= for same type");

                loc_push_restore(&first_opt[type].loc);

                error_report("This is the conflicting setting");

                loc_pop(&first_opt[type].loc);

                exit(1);

            }

        } else {

            first_opt[type].seen = true;

            first_opt[type].headertype = entry;

            loc_save(&first_opt[type].loc);

        }

    }

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The use of 'exit(1)' to terminate the program in case of a collision is considered insecure because it leads to abrupt termination without proper cleanup, potentially leaving resources unreleased or data in an inconsistent state, which could lead to Denial of Service (DoS) scenarios."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
