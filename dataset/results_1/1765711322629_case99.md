# Case 99

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 17df768c1e4580f03301d18ea938d3557d441911

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
int load_image_targphys(const char *filename,

			target_phys_addr_t addr, int max_sz)

{

    int size;



    size = get_image_size(filename);

    if (size > 0)

        rom_add_file_fixed(filename, addr, -1);

    return size;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 8,
    "explanation": "The function does not check if the size retrieved from 'get_image_size' is less than the maximum size 'max_sz' before adding the file. This could lead to a buffer overflow if 'rom_add_file_fixed' does not handle larger sizes safely."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
