# Case 11

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 12848bfc5d719bad536c5448205a3226be1fda47

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static int local_post_create_passthrough(FsContext *fs_ctx, const char *path,

        FsCred *credp)

{

    if (chmod(rpath(fs_ctx, path), credp->fc_mode & 07777) < 0) {

        return -1;

    }

    if (chown(rpath(fs_ctx, path), credp->fc_uid, credp->fc_gid) < 0) {

        return -1;

    }

    return 0;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 4,
    "explanation": "The code uses 'chmod' and 'chown' functions without sufficient validation of the inputs. If the 'path' variable is user-controlled, this could lead to a directory traversal vulnerability, allowing an attacker to change permissions or ownership of arbitrary files, potentially leading to privilege escalation."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
