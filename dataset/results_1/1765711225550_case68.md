# Case 68

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 14b6160099f0caf5dc9d62e637b007bc5d719a96

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
bool qdict_get_bool(const QDict *qdict, const char *key)

{

    QObject *obj = qdict_get_obj(qdict, key, QTYPE_QBOOL);

    return qbool_get_bool(qobject_to_qbool(obj));

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code safely retrieves a boolean value from a dictionary by first obtaining an object and then converting it to the appropriate type. There are no apparent resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or DoS attacks as the operations are straightforward and supported by the type system."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
