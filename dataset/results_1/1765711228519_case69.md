# Case 69

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: c3e10c7b4377c1cbc0a4fbc12312c2cf41c0cda7

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void OPPROTO op_405_check_ov (void)

{

    do_405_check_ov();

    RETURN();

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The provided code does not show any direct vulnerabilities such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or potential DoS attacks. The function appears to call another function and then returns without manipulating any resources or performing operations that could lead to security issues."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
