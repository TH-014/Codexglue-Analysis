# Case 56

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: f0aa7a8b2d518c54430e4382309281b93e51981a

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void do_loadvm(Monitor *mon, const QDict *qdict)

{

    int saved_vm_running  = vm_running;

    const char *name = qdict_get_str(qdict, "name");



    vm_stop(0);



    if (load_vmstate(name) >= 0 && saved_vm_running)

        vm_start();

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code exhibits a potential use-after-free vulnerability since the function 'load_vmstate' may lead to a situation where the virtual machine state is loaded and then allowed to run without proper checks. If 'load_vmstate' returns an invalid state or if there is any memory reliance on previously allocated resources, this could lead to accessing freed resources. Moreover, if 'vm_start()' is invoked without ensuring that previous VM states are safely handled, it can lead to stability issues and potential Denial of Service (DoS) conditions."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
