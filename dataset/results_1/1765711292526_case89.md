### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: bea60dd7679364493a0d7f5b54316c767cf894ef

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void send_ext_key_event_ack(VncState *vs)

{

    vnc_lock_output(vs);

    vnc_write_u8(vs, VNC_MSG_SERVER_FRAMEBUFFER_UPDATE);

    vnc_write_u8(vs, 0);

    vnc_write_u16(vs, 1);

    vnc_framebuffer_update(vs, 0, 0,

                           surface_width(vs->vd->ds),

                           surface_height(vs->vd->ds),

                           VNC_ENCODING_EXT_KEY_EVENT);

    vnc_unlock_output(vs);

    vnc_flush(vs);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code appears to be secure as it properly locks and unlocks output during the operation, ensuring that resources are managed correctly. There are no visible resource leaks or vulnerabilities like use-after-free or DoS attacks evident in this snippet."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
