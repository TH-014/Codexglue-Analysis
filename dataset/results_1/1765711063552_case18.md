### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: b6fcf32d9b851a83dedcb609091236b97cc4a985

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void visit_nested_struct_list(Visitor *v, void **native, Error **errp)

{

    visit_type_UserDefNestedList(v, (UserDefNestedList **)native, NULL, errp);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 5,
    "explanation": "The code uses a double pointer without proper handling of memory management, which could lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities or resource leaks if the memory is not appropriately allocated or deallocated."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
