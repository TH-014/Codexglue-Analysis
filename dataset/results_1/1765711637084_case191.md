## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 18,
    "explanation": "The code lacks proper error handling for accessing user memory. Specifically, if 'get_user_u32' fails, it does not robustly handle the situation, potentially leading to memory corruption or crashes. Additionally, the comment indicates that segfaults should be checked, but this is not implemented. Such oversights can expose the code to vulnerabilities like use-after-free or memory access violations."
