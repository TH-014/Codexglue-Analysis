## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
struct GuestFileRead *qmp_guest_file_read(int64_t handle, bool has_count,
                                          int64_t count, Error **errp)
{
    GuestFileHandle *gfh = guest_file_handle_find(handle, errp);
    GuestFileRead *read_data = NULL;
    guchar *buf;
    FILE *fh;
    size_t read_count;
    if (!gfh) {
    if (!has_count) {
        count = QGA_READ_COUNT_DEFAULT;
    } else if (count < 0) {
        error_setg(errp, "value '%" PRId64 "' is invalid for argument count",
                   count);
    fh = gfh->fh;
    buf = g_malloc0(count+1);
    read_count = fread(buf, 1, count, fh);
    if (ferror(fh)) {
        error_setg_errno(errp, errno, "failed to read file");
        slog("guest-file-read failed, handle: %" PRId64, handle);
    } else {
        buf[read_count] = 0;
        read_data = g_new0(GuestFileRead, 1);
        read_data->count = read_count;
        read_data->eof = feof(fh);
        if (read_count) {
            read_data->buf_b64 = g_base64_encode(buf, read_count);
        gfh->state = RW_STATE_READING;
    g_free(buf);
    clearerr(fh);
    return read_data;

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 20,
    "explanation": "This code is insecure due to potential resource leaks, specifically because if 'gfh' is NULL, 'g_malloc0' is called without checking if the file handle 'fh' is valid and not NULL. If 'fh' is NULL and an attempt is made to read from it, it could lead to undefined behavior. Additionally, if an error occurs during the read operation, there is no cleanup of allocated memory, which can lead to a memory leak."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
