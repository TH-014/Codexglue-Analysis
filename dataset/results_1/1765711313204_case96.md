# Case 96

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: e83980455c8c7eb066405de512be7c4bace3ac4d

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
int virtio_bus_device_plugged(VirtIODevice *vdev)

{

    DeviceState *qdev = DEVICE(vdev);

    BusState *qbus = BUS(qdev_get_parent_bus(qdev));

    VirtioBusState *bus = VIRTIO_BUS(qbus);

    VirtioBusClass *klass = VIRTIO_BUS_GET_CLASS(bus);

    VirtioDeviceClass *vdc = VIRTIO_DEVICE_GET_CLASS(vdev);



    DPRINTF("%s: plug device.\n", qbus->name);



    if (klass->device_plugged != NULL) {

        klass->device_plugged(qbus->parent);

    }



    /* Get the features of the plugged device. */

    assert(vdc->get_features != NULL);

    vdev->host_features = vdc->get_features(vdev, vdev->host_features);

    return 0;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code does not exhibit any common vulnerabilities such as resource leaks, use-after-free issues, or denial-of-service attacks. It properly checks if the function pointers are not NULL before invoking them, and no memory allocations or deallocations are present that could lead to resource leaks."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
