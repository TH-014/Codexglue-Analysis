# Case 192

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 4524051c32190c1dc13ec2ccd122fd120dbed736

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
char *qemu_find_file(int type, const char *name)

{

    int len;

    const char *subdir;

    char *buf;



    /* Try the name as a straight path first */

    if (access(name, R_OK) == 0) {

        return g_strdup(name);

    }

    switch (type) {

    case QEMU_FILE_TYPE_BIOS:

        subdir = "";

        break;

    case QEMU_FILE_TYPE_KEYMAP:

        subdir = "keymaps/";

        break;

    default:

        abort();

    }

    len = strlen(data_dir) + strlen(name) + strlen(subdir) + 2;

    buf = g_malloc0(len);

    snprintf(buf, len, "%s/%s%s", data_dir, subdir, name);

    if (access(buf, R_OK)) {

        g_free(buf);

        return NULL;

    }

    return buf;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code potentially leads to a resource leak as it dynamically allocates memory using g_malloc0 but does not ensure that the allocated memory is freed properly in all execution paths, particularly if access fails after allocation. Additionally, if the input 'name' is controlled by an attacker, it can lead to directory traversal vulnerabilities or access to unauthorized files."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
