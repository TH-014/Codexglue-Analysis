# Case 167

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 72cf2d4f0e181d0d3a3122e04129c58a95da713e

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void do_attach(USBDevice *dev)

{

    USBBus *bus = usb_bus_from_device(dev);

    USBPort *port;



    if (dev->attached) {

        fprintf(stderr, "Warning: tried to attach usb device %s twice\n",

                dev->devname);

        return;

    }

    dev->attached++;



    port = TAILQ_FIRST(&bus->free);

    TAILQ_REMOVE(&bus->free, port, next);

    bus->nfree--;



    usb_attach(port, dev);



    TAILQ_INSERT_TAIL(&bus->used, port, next);

    bus->nused++;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code does not perform proper checks for the validity of the 'port' object obtained from 'TAILQ_FIRST(&bus->free)'. If 'bus->free' is empty, this could lead to dereferencing a null pointer or accessing an invalid memory location, which may result in a use-after-free vulnerability or segmentation fault."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
