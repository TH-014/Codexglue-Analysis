# Case 74

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: c7f8d0f3a52b5ef8fdcd305cce438f67d7e06a9f

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void pc_machine_device_post_plug_cb(HotplugHandler *hotplug_dev,

                                           DeviceState *dev, Error **errp)

{

    if (object_dynamic_cast(OBJECT(dev), TYPE_PC_DIMM)) {

        pc_dimm_post_plug(hotplug_dev, dev, errp);

    }

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The provided code snippet checks the type of the device using 'object_dynamic_cast' before performing operations on it. This type-checking prevents operations on invalid or incompatible object types, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities such as use-after-free. Additionally, there is no evidence of resource leaks or denial of service (DoS) attacks in this context."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
