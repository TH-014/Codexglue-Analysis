# Case 10

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 697ab892786d47008807a49f57b2fd86adfcd098

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void gen_b(DisasContext *ctx)

{

    target_ulong li, target;



    ctx->exception = POWERPC_EXCP_BRANCH;

    /* sign extend LI */

#if defined(TARGET_PPC64)

    if (ctx->sf_mode)

        li = ((int64_t)LI(ctx->opcode) << 38) >> 38;

    else

#endif

        li = ((int32_t)LI(ctx->opcode) << 6) >> 6;

    if (likely(AA(ctx->opcode) == 0))

        target = ctx->nip + li - 4;

    else

        target = li;

    if (LK(ctx->opcode))

        gen_setlr(ctx, ctx->nip);


    gen_goto_tb(ctx, 0, target);

}
```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The function uses a calculated target address to perform a branch operation but lacks proper validation or bounds checking for the computed address. This can lead to potential use-after-free vulnerabilities or other memory safety issues, since an attacker could manipulate the opcode to create an invalid target address, leading to unexpected behavior in the program."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
