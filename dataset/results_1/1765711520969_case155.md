# Case 155

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 3f7638ec4093100a63b18cbacd45dcd847f7c06b

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void qemu_init_vcpu(void *_env)

{

    CPUState *env = _env;



    if (kvm_enabled())

        kvm_init_vcpu(env);

    env->nr_cores = smp_cores;

    env->nr_threads = smp_threads;

    return;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code does not exhibit obvious insecure patterns such as resource leaks or use-after-free vulnerabilities. The parameters are correctly handled within the function context and there are no signs of uninitialized variables or potential for Denial-of-Service attacks."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
