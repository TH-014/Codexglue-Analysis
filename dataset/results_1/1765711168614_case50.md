# Case 50

### Real verdict: 1

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

{

    void *ptr = NULL;

#if CONFIG_MEMALIGN_HACK

    long diff;

#endif



    /* let's disallow possible ambiguous cases */

    if(size > (INT_MAX-32) )

        return NULL;



#if CONFIG_MEMALIGN_HACK

    ptr = malloc(size+32);

    if(!ptr)

        return ptr;

    diff= ((-(long)ptr - 1)&31) + 1;

    ptr = (char*)ptr + diff;

    ((char*)ptr)[-1]= diff;

    if (posix_memalign(&ptr,32,size))

        ptr = NULL;

#elif HAVE_MEMALIGN

    ptr = memalign(32,size);

    /* Why 64?

       Indeed, we should align it:

         on 4 for 386

         on 16 for 486

         on 32 for 586, PPro - K6-III

         on 64 for K7 (maybe for P3 too).

       Because L1 and L2 caches are aligned on those values.

       But I don't want to code such logic here!

     */

     /* Why 32?

        For AVX ASM. SSE / NEON needs only 16.

        Why not larger? Because I did not see a difference in benchmarks ...

     */

     /* benchmarks with P3

        memalign(64)+1          3071,3051,3032

        memalign(64)+2          3051,3032,3041

        memalign(64)+4          2911,2896,2915

        memalign(64)+32         2546,2545,2571

        memalign(64)+64         2570,2533,2558



        BTW, malloc seems to do 8-byte alignment by default here.

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code has potential for resource leaks due to a lack of proper error handling. If memory allocation fails (i.e., malloc returns NULL), the function returns NULL but does not free any previously allocated resources if they exist. There is also the complexity introduced by the alignment logic, which can lead to undefined behavior if the returned pointer is mishandled or if the alignment falls out of expected ranges."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
