# Case 169

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 966439a67830239a6c520c5df6c55627b8153c8b

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void do_divduo (void)

{

    if (likely((uint64_t)T1 != 0)) {

        xer_ov = 0;

        T0 = (uint64_t)T0 / (uint64_t)T1;

    } else {

        xer_so = 1;

        xer_ov = 1;

        T0 = 0;

    }

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 6,
    "explanation": "The code performs division without checking if T1 is zero before the division operation. This can lead to a division by zero error, which may cause a denial of service (DoS) condition, making the system unresponsive or crashing."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
