# Case 110

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: ec05ec26f940564b1e07bf88857035ec27e21dd8

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void memory_region_ram_resize(MemoryRegion *mr, ram_addr_t newsize, Error **errp)

{

    assert(mr->terminates);



    qemu_ram_resize(mr->ram_addr, newsize, errp);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 6,
    "explanation": "The function calls qemu_ram_resize without checking if the operation may cause a resource leak or if the new size is valid, potentially leading to memory exhaustion or failure in memory allocation, which could be exploited for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
