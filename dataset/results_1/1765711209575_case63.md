# Case 63

### Real verdict: 0

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
qemu_irq *mcf_intc_init(MemoryRegion *sysmem,

                        target_phys_addr_t base,

                        CPUM68KState *env)

{

    mcf_intc_state *s;



    s = g_malloc0(sizeof(mcf_intc_state));

    s->env = env;

    mcf_intc_reset(s);



    memory_region_init_io(&s->iomem, &mcf_intc_ops, s, "mcf", 0x100);

    memory_region_add_subregion(sysmem, base, &s->iomem);



    return qemu_allocate_irqs(mcf_intc_set_irq, s, 64);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The function does not free the allocated memory for 'mcf_intc_state' after use, which can lead to a resource leak. Additionally, there is no error handling if 'qemu_allocate_irqs' fails, which may lead to potential use-after-free vulnerabilities if the resources are accessed afterward."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
