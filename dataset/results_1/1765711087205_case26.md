# Case 26

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 7d1b0095bff7157e856d1d0e6c4295641ced2752

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static inline TCGv gen_ld16u(TCGv addr, int index)

{

    TCGv tmp = new_tmp();

    tcg_gen_qemu_ld16u(tmp, addr, index);

    return tmp;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code snippet simply defines an inline function that loads a 16-bit unsigned value from an address. It uses a temporary variable and does not exhibit issues such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or denial of service attacks. No security flaws are apparent."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
