# Case 102

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 5fe79386ba3cdc86fd808dde301bfc5bb7e9bded

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void pc_machine_set_nvdimm(Object *obj, bool value, Error **errp)

{

    PCMachineState *pcms = PC_MACHINE(obj);



    pcms->nvdimm = value;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code does not appear to have any resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or other common security issues. It correctly sets a boolean value for nvdimm in the PCMachineState structure without any potential misuse of memory."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
