# Case 149

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 5e715b583dab85735660b15a8d217a69164675fe

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static int parse_metadata_ext(DBEContext *s)

{

    if (s->mtd_ext_size)

        skip_input(s, s->key_present + s->mtd_ext_size + 1);

    return 0;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 5,
    "explanation": "The function potentially skips input based on the size of mtd_ext_size without verifying its bounds, which could lead to a buffer overflow or access to unintended memory locations. If the value of s->key_present + s->mtd_ext_size + 1 exceeds the actual buffer size, it may lead to memory corruption, increasing the risk of resource leaks and vulnerabilities."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
