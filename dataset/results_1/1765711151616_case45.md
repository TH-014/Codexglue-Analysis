# Case 45

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 60fe637bf0e4d7989e21e50f52526444765c63b4

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static int get_int8(QEMUFile *f, void *pv, size_t size)

{

    int8_t *v = pv;

    qemu_get_s8s(f, v);

    return 0;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code appears to be secure as it properly handles a single byte read operation without any visible resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or potential for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. There are no indications of improper memory management or unsafe operations."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
