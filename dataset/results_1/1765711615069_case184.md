# Case 184

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: ce5b1bbf624b977a55ff7f85bb3871682d03baff

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void lm32_cpu_initfn(Object *obj)

{

    CPUState *cs = CPU(obj);

    LM32CPU *cpu = LM32_CPU(obj);

    CPULM32State *env = &cpu->env;

    static bool tcg_initialized;



    cs->env_ptr = env;

    cpu_exec_init(cs, &error_abort);



    env->flags = 0;



    if (tcg_enabled() && !tcg_initialized) {

        tcg_initialized = true;

        lm32_translate_init();

    }

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code initializes various CPU states and checks if TCG (Tiny Code Generator) is enabled before initializing translation. There are no resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or indications of DoS attacks present in the provided snippet."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
