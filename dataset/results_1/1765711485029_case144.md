## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static int read_packet(AVFormatContext *s, AVPacket *pkt)

{

    ASSContext *ass = s->priv_data;

    uint8_t *p, *end;



    if (ass->event_index >= ass->event_count)

        return AVERROR(EIO);



    p = ass->event[ass->event_index];



    end = strchr(p, '\n');

    av_new_packet(pkt, end ? end - p + 1 : strlen(p));

    pkt->flags |= AV_PKT_FLAG_KEY;

    pkt->pos    = p - ass->event_buffer + s->streams[0]->codec->extradata_size;

    pkt->pts    = pkt->dts = get_pts(p);

    memcpy(pkt->data, p, pkt->size);



    ass->event_index++;



    return 0;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code may lead to a buffer overflow because the size of the allocated packet (pkt) is determined using 'end - p + 1', but there is no check to ensure that 'end' is not NULL. If 'strchr' does not find a newline character, 'end' will be NULL, resulting in an invalid memory allocation which can potentially overwrite adjacent memory, causing security vulnerabilities such as crashes or exploitation."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
