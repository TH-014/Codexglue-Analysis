# Case 193

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 2c62f08ddbf3fa80dc7202eb9a2ea60ae44e2cc5

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void omap_screen_dump(void *opaque, const char *filename, bool cswitch,

                             Error **errp)

{

    struct omap_lcd_panel_s *omap_lcd = opaque;

    DisplaySurface *surface = qemu_console_surface(omap_lcd->con);



    omap_update_display(opaque);

    if (omap_lcd && surface_data(surface))

        omap_ppm_save(filename, surface_data(surface),

                    omap_lcd->width, omap_lcd->height,

                    surface_stride(surface), errp);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code does not have any obvious vulnerabilities such as resource leaks, use-after-free bugs, or potential DoS conditions. The function appears to operate on input data correctly, ensuring proper use of structures and function calls without visible flaws."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
