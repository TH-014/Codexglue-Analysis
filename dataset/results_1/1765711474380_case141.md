# Case 141

### Real verdict: 0

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void fd_put_buffer(void *opaque, const uint8_t *buf,

                          int64_t pos, int size)

{

    QEMUFileFD *s = opaque;

    ssize_t len;



    do {

        len = write(s->fd, buf, size);

    } while (len == -1 && errno == EINTR);



    if (len == -1)

        len = -errno;



    /* When the fd becomes writable again, register a callback to do

     * a put notify */

    if (len == -EAGAIN)

        qemu_set_fd_handler2(s->fd, NULL, NULL, fd_put_notify, s);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code does not handle the situation where 'write' fails due to reasons other than EINTR or EAGAIN. This could lead to resource leaks since the failure to write and register a callback may cause the buffer to remain unprocessed, potentially leading to a denial of service (DoS) situation if this pattern occurs frequently."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
