# Case 35

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 05340be97bc395ca0b544c6d856469894ecbf5eb

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static int img_read_seek(AVFormatContext *s, int stream_index, int64_t timestamp, int flags)

{

    VideoDemuxData *s1 = s->priv_data;



    if (timestamp < 0 || timestamp > s1->img_last - s1->img_first)

        return -1;

    s1->img_number = timestamp + s1->img_first;

    return 0;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code does not exhibit any immediate vulnerabilities such as resource leaks, use-after-free, or potential DoS attacks. It checks whether the timestamp is valid and updates the image number accordingly, without any unsafe memory operations."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
