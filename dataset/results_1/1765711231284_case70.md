## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 20,
    "explanation": "The code does not check the return value of 'qcow2_free_clusters', which could lead to resource leaks if the freeing of clusters fails. Additionally, there is a potential issue with the management of memory for snapshot IDs and names, as they are freed without ensuring they were properly initialized or allocated, leading to possible use-after-free vulnerabilities."
}
```
