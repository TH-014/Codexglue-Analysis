### Commit Id: c2b38b277a7882a592f4f2ec955084b2b756daaa

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static bool aio_epoll_enabled(AioContext *ctx)

{

    /* Fall back to ppoll when external clients are disabled. */

    return !aio_external_disabled(ctx) && ctx->epoll_enabled;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code snippet performs a safe conditional check on the state of 'aio_external_disabled' and 'ctx->epoll_enabled'. There are no resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or indications of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks present in this code."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
