# Case 120

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: ea375f9ab8c76686dca0af8cb4f87a4eb569cad3

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void kvm_reset_vcpu(void *opaque)

{

    CPUState *env = opaque;



    kvm_arch_reset_vcpu(env);

    if (kvm_arch_put_registers(env)) {

        fprintf(stderr, "Fatal: kvm vcpu reset failed\n");

        abort();

    }

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The use of 'abort()' in the case of a failure can lead to resource leaks, as it terminates the program abruptly without proper cleanup. If there are allocated resources, they may not be released, which leads to a denial of service (DoS) scenario."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
