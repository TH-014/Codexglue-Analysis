# Case 61

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 82be8e7394b31fd2d740651365b8ebdd0c847529

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
int kvmppc_get_htab_fd(bool write)

{

    struct kvm_get_htab_fd s = {

        .flags = write ? KVM_GET_HTAB_WRITE : 0,

        .start_index = 0,

    };



    if (!cap_htab_fd) {

        fprintf(stderr, "KVM version doesn't support saving the hash table\n");

        return -1;

    }



    return kvm_vm_ioctl(kvm_state, KVM_PPC_GET_HTAB_FD, &s);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code does proper input validation by checking if 'cap_htab_fd' is null before proceeding with the function's main logic, which helps prevent potential issues. Additionally, the handling of conditions seems safe, and there are no evident resource leaks or vulnerabilities such as use-after-free."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
