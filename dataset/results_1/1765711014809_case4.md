# Case 4

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 4678124bb9bfb49e93b83f95c4d2feeb443ea38b

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void acpi_add_table(GArray *table_offsets, GArray *table_data)

{

    uint32_t offset = cpu_to_le32(table_data->len);

    g_array_append_val(table_offsets, offset);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The function appears to simply append an offset value to a GArray without any apparent flaws such as memory leaks or unsafe operations. It does not manipulate pointers or manage memory directly, which reduces security risks."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
