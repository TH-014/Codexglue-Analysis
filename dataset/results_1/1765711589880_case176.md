### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 058bc4b57f9d6b39d9a6748b4049e1be3fde3dac

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void phys_sections_clear(void)

{

    phys_sections_nb = 0;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The function 'phys_sections_clear' simply resets the variable 'phys_sections_nb' to 0 without any resource allocation or manipulation that could lead to vulnerabilities. No insecure practices such as resource leaks or use-after-free are present."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
