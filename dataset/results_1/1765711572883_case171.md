# Case 171

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: f6774f905fb3cfdc319523ac640be30b14c1bc55

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void ff_mpeg_draw_horiz_band(MpegEncContext *s, int y, int h)

{

    ff_draw_horiz_band(s->avctx, &s->current_picture.f,

                       &s->last_picture.f, y, h, s->picture_structure,

                       s->first_field, s->low_delay);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The function appears to call another function to draw a horizontal band, and does not exhibit any signs of resource leaks or other vulnerabilities such as use-after-free or DoS attacks. There are no indications of improper memory management or unchecked parameters."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
