# Case 64

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 87e8788680e16c51f6048af26f3f7830c35207a5

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static int mmf_probe(AVProbeData *p)

{

    /* check file header */

    if (p->buf_size <= 32)

        return 0;

    if (p->buf[0] == 'M' && p->buf[1] == 'M' &&

        p->buf[2] == 'M' && p->buf[3] == 'D' &&

        p->buf[8] == 'C' && p->buf[9] == 'N' &&

        p->buf[10] == 'T' && p->buf[11] == 'I')

        return AVPROBE_SCORE_MAX;

    else

        return 0;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code checks the buffer size before accessing its elements, ensuring that it does not read out of bounds. It does not contain any resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or indications of a potential DoS attack."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
