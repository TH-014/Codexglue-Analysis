# Case 55

### Real verdict: 1

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void smc91c111_init(NICInfo *nd, uint32_t base, qemu_irq irq)

{

    smc91c111_state *s;

    int iomemtype;



    qemu_check_nic_model(nd, "smc91c111");



    s = (smc91c111_state *)qemu_mallocz(sizeof(smc91c111_state));

    iomemtype = cpu_register_io_memory(0, smc91c111_readfn,

                                       smc91c111_writefn, s);

    cpu_register_physical_memory(base, 16, iomemtype);

    s->irq = irq;

    memcpy(s->macaddr, nd->macaddr, 6);



    smc91c111_reset(s);



    s->vc = qemu_new_vlan_client(nd->vlan, nd->model, nd->name,

                                 smc91c111_receive, smc91c111_can_receive, s);

    qemu_format_nic_info_str(s->vc, s->macaddr);

    /* ??? Save/restore.  */

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 12,
    "explanation": "The code potentially leads to a resource leak as it allocates memory using qemu_mallocz for 's' but does not appear to release it. If the initialization is called multiple times or if an error occurs before the end of the function, the allocated memory will not be freed, which could lead to exhaustion of heap memory."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
