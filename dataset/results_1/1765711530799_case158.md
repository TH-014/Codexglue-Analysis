# Case 158

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: a0c624e299730c8c5800375c2f5f3c6c200053ff

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static int v4l2_receive_frame(AVCodecContext *avctx, AVFrame *frame)

{

    V4L2m2mContext *s = avctx->priv_data;

    V4L2Context *const capture = &s->capture;

    V4L2Context *const output = &s->output;

    AVPacket avpkt = {0};

    int ret;



    ret = ff_decode_get_packet(avctx, &avpkt);

    if (ret < 0 && ret != AVERROR_EOF)

        return ret;



    if (s->draining)

        goto dequeue;



    ret = ff_v4l2_context_enqueue_packet(output, &avpkt);

    if (ret < 0) {

        if (ret != AVERROR(ENOMEM))

           return ret;

        /* no input buffers available, continue dequeing */

    }



    if (avpkt.size) {

        ret = v4l2_try_start(avctx);

        if (ret)

            return 0;

    }



dequeue:

    return ff_v4l2_context_dequeue_frame(capture, frame);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 13,
    "explanation": "The code does not handle the case where 'ff_v4l2_context_dequeue_frame' can potentially return an error code that isn't checked. This leaves a chance for resource leaks if the memory is not properly managed or released, especially if the function ends up being called without proper validation of its state. Moreover, 'ret = ff_v4l2_context_enqueue_packet' can also return -ENOMEM, which is indicative of a memory allocation failure, but subsequent handling of that case is incomplete, potentially leading to denial of service scenarios."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
