# Case 134

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 66b9b43c42049bcae37668e890fedde9a72c8167

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void watch_mem_write(void *opaque, hwaddr addr,

                            uint64_t val, unsigned size)

{

    check_watchpoint(addr & ~TARGET_PAGE_MASK, size, BP_MEM_WRITE);

    switch (size) {

    case 1:

        stb_phys(&address_space_memory, addr, val);

        break;

    case 2:

        stw_phys(&address_space_memory, addr, val);

        break;

    case 4:

        stl_phys(&address_space_memory, addr, val);

        break;

    default: abort();

    }

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The use of 'abort()' in the default case presents a potential risk as it may cause the program to terminate unexpectedly without proper error handling, leading to resource leaks or inconsistent state. Additionally, depending on how 'check_watchpoint' is implemented, if 'addr' is not properly validated, it could lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
