# Case 16

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 7e8fe4be5fb4c98aa3c6a4ed3cec999f4e3cc3aa

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static int pad_count(const AVFilterPad *pads)

{

    int count;



    if (!pads)

        return 0;



    for(count = 0; pads->name; count ++) pads ++;

    return count;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 6,
    "explanation": "The code may lead to a resource leak if the pads pointer is not properly managed, especially if it points to dynamically allocated memory that is not freed. Additionally, there is no check for the bounds of the pads array, which can lead to accessing out of bounds if pads is not null but still contains invalid data."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
