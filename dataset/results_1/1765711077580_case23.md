# Case 23

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 30ca440eec9fe1d7eec5a48addac656438778278

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static QOSState *pci_test_start(int socket)

{

    const char *cmd = "-netdev socket,fd=%d,id=hs0 -device "

                      "virtio-net-pci,netdev=hs0";



    return qtest_pc_boot(cmd, socket);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The function returns a pointer from 'qtest_pc_boot' without checking if the pointer is null or if it is being properly managed, which could lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities or resource leaks if the allocated memory is not handled correctly."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
