# Case 105

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: e0d9c6f93729c9bfc98fcafcd73098bb8e131aeb

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
int qcow2_backing_read1(BlockDriverState *bs, QEMUIOVector *qiov,

                  int64_t sector_num, int nb_sectors)

{

    int n1;

    if ((sector_num + nb_sectors) <= bs->total_sectors)

        return nb_sectors;

    if (sector_num >= bs->total_sectors)

        n1 = 0;

    else

        n1 = bs->total_sectors - sector_num;



    qemu_iovec_memset(qiov, 0, 512 * (nb_sectors - n1));



    return n1;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code does not validate the number of sectors being read against the limits of the total sectors before calling 'qemu_iovec_memset'. This can lead to memory corruption or buffer overflows if 'nb_sectors' is not correctly bounded, potentially allowing for a DoS attack or a use-after-free vulnerability."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
