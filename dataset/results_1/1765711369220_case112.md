# Case 112

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 3456a8d1852e970688b73d03fdc44dde851759e1

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void bdrv_qed_invalidate_cache(BlockDriverState *bs)
{
    BDRVQEDState *s = bs->opaque;
    bdrv_qed_close(bs);
    memset(s, 0, sizeof(BDRVQEDState));
    bdrv_qed_open(bs, NULL, bs->open_flags, NULL);
}
```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 5,
    "explanation": "The code attempts to reset the structure 's' using memset after closing it. However, if 's' is a pointer that has already been freed or is uninitialized, this could lead to undefined behavior or a use-after-free vulnerability. The absence of checks to ensure that 's' is a valid pointer before using it makes this code insecure."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
