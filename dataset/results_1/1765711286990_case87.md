# Case 87

### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: e3f5ec2b5e92706e3b807059f79b1fb5d936e567

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static ssize_t tap_receive_iov(void *opaque, const struct iovec *iov,

                               int iovcnt)

{

    TAPState *s = opaque;

    ssize_t len;



    do {

        len = writev(s->fd, iov, iovcnt);

    } while (len == -1 && (errno == EINTR || errno == EAGAIN));



    return len;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code writes data using 'writev' in a loop under certain conditions. If 'len' is -1 due to temporary errors (EINTR or EAGAIN), it retries without any mechanism to prevent infinite looping or resource exhaustion. This could lead to a denial of service (DoS) if the conditions persist, as the loop may run indefinitely and exhaust system resources."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
