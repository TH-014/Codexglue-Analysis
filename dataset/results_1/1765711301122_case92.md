# Case 92

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: c23c15d30b901bb447cdcada96cae64c0046d146

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
int qemu_acl_remove(qemu_acl *acl,

                    const char *match)

{

    qemu_acl_entry *entry;

    int i = 0;



    QTAILQ_FOREACH(entry, &acl->entries, next) {

        i++;

        if (strcmp(entry->match, match) == 0) {

            QTAILQ_REMOVE(&acl->entries, entry, next);




            return i;

        }

    }

    return -1;

}
```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code correctly removes an entry from a linked list of access control entries without introducing apparent resource leaks or vulnerabilities. It uses proper checks and handles the linked list structure correctly."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
