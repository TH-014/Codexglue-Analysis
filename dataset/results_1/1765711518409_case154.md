### Real verdict: 0
### Commit Id: 1f001dc7bc9e435bf231a5b0edcad1c7c2bd6214

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static int default_fdset_dup_fd_find(int dup_fd)

{

    return -1;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 4,
    "explanation": "The function does not take any action on the input and always returns -1. This can lead to a security issue as it doesn't handle the provided file descriptor in a secure manner, potentially leading to undefined behavior or resource leaks without proper checks or error handling."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
