# Case 179

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 0b54f3c0878a3acaa9142e4f24942e762d97e350

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static void GLZWDecodeInit(GifState * s, int csize)

{

    /* read buffer */

    s->eob_reached = 0;

    s->pbuf = s->buf;

    s->ebuf = s->buf;

    s->bbuf = 0;

    s->bbits = 0;



    /* decoder */

    s->codesize = csize;

    s->cursize = s->codesize + 1;

    s->curmask = mask[s->cursize];

    s->top_slot = 1 << s->cursize;

    s->clear_code = 1 << s->codesize;

    s->end_code = s->clear_code + 1;

    s->slot = s->newcodes = s->clear_code + 2;

    s->oc = s->fc = 0;

    s->sp = s->stack;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "The code initializes a structure and its variables without any operations that could lead to resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities, or potential DoS attacks. All variables are assigned properly, and there are no indications of unsafe memory handling."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
