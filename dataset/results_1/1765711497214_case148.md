## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
void usb_device_attach(USBDevice *dev, Error **errp)

{

    USBBus *bus = usb_bus_from_device(dev);

    USBPort *port = dev->port;

    char devspeed[32], portspeed[32];



    assert(port != NULL);

    assert(!dev->attached);

    usb_mask_to_str(devspeed, sizeof(devspeed), dev->speedmask);

    usb_mask_to_str(portspeed, sizeof(portspeed), port->speedmask);

    trace_usb_port_attach(bus->busnr, port->path,

                          devspeed, portspeed);



    if (!(port->speedmask & dev->speedmask)) {

        error_setg(errp, "Warning: speed mismatch trying to attach"

                   " usb device \"%s\" (%s speed)"

                   " to bus \"%s\", port \"%s\" (%s speed)",

                   dev->product_desc, devspeed,

                   bus->qbus.name, port->path, portspeed);

        return;

    dev->attached++;

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 16,
    "explanation": "The code increments dev->attached without proper checks on its maximum allowable value, which can lead to an integer overflow or improper state if dev->attached is not validated. This could potentially result in resource leaks or undefined behaviors, making the code insecure."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
