# Case 17

### Real verdict: 1
### Commit Id: 3a661f1eabf7e8db66e28489884d9b54aacb94ea

## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
int qcrypto_cipher_setiv(QCryptoCipher *cipher,

                         const uint8_t *iv, size_t niv,

                         Error **errp)

{

    QCryptoCipherNettle *ctx = cipher->opaque;

    if (niv != ctx->niv) {

        error_setg(errp, "Expected IV size %zu not %zu",

                   ctx->niv, niv);

        return -1;

    }

    memcpy(ctx->iv, iv, niv);

    return 0;

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code does not check if the destination buffer 'ctx->iv' has sufficient space to accommodate the data being copied from 'iv'. If the size of 'iv' (niv) exceeds the allocated size of 'ctx->iv', this could lead to a buffer overflow, exposing the application to various vulnerabilities, including potential arbitrary code execution."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
