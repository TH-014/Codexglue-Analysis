## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
iscsi_connect_cb(struct iscsi_context *iscsi, int status, void *command_data,

                 void *opaque)

{

    struct IscsiTask *itask = opaque;

    struct scsi_task *task;



    if (status != 0) {

        itask->status   = 1;

        itask->complete = 1;

        return;

    }



    task = iscsi_inquiry_task(iscsi, itask->iscsilun->lun,

                              0, 0, 36,

                              iscsi_inquiry_cb, opaque);

    if (task == NULL) {

        error_report("iSCSI: failed to send inquiry command.");

        itask->status   = 1;

        itask->complete = 1;

        return;

    }

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The code checks if 'task' is NULL but does not handle potential resource leaks or cleanup of allocated resources if 'iscsi_inquiry_task' is called successfully. If inquiry command fails and 'itask' is in a state that should not allow further operations, the code sets status and complete flags but these flags do not seem to trigger any cleanup procedure. This can lead to resource leaks. Additionally, there are potential use-after-free vulnerabilities if 'opaque' is accessed after 'itask' is modified improperly."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  Yes
