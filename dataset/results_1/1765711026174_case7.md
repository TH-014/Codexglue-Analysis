## Prompt:

"""Given a source code, the task is to identify whether it is an insecure code that may attack software systems, such as resource leaks, use-after-free vulnerabilities and DoS attack.  Treat the task as binary classification (0/1), where 1 stands for insecure code and 0 for secure code.

```
static inline void gen_op_evsrws(TCGv_i32 ret, TCGv_i32 arg1, TCGv_i32 arg2)

{

    TCGv_i32 t0;

    int l1, l2;



    l1 = gen_new_label();

    l2 = gen_new_label();

    t0 = tcg_temp_local_new_i32();

    /* No error here: 6 bits are used */

    tcg_gen_andi_i32(t0, arg2, 0x3F);

    tcg_gen_brcondi_i32(TCG_COND_GE, t0, 32, l1);

    tcg_gen_sar_i32(ret, arg1, t0);

    tcg_gen_br(l2);

    gen_set_label(l1);

    tcg_gen_movi_i32(ret, 0);

    gen_set_label(l2);

    tcg_temp_free_i32(t0);

}

```

Output Format:
```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": <which line causes the threat>,
    "explanation": "----<explain why you classify this as insecure>------"
}
```

or

```
{
    "prediction": 0,
    "line no": 0,
    "explanation": "<how is this secure>"
}
```

Strictly follow this output format."""


## Response:

```
{
    "prediction": 1,
    "line no": 10,
    "explanation": "The use of 'tcg_temp_free_i32(t0)' suggests that 't0' is dynamically allocated. If 'tcg_temp_local_new_i32()' fails to allocate memory, this can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability, as there's no check for allocation success before freeing 't0'."
}
```

## Verdict matched?:  No
